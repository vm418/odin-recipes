    <h1>Chocolate Chip Pancakes</h1>

    <img src="../images/pancakes.jpeg">

    <p> This is my go-to recipe for chocolate chip pancakes. The pancakes come out 
        super fluffy and the whole family loves them. Add as many chocolate chips as 
        you like. Can easily be doubled or tripled. Serve with maple syrup if you like.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2  cup miniature chocolate chips, or more to taste</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine milk and vinegar in a bowl and set aside for 5 minutes to "sour" the milk. 
            You are essentially making your own buttermilk with this step
        </li>
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>
            Whisk egg, butter, and vanilla extract into "soured" milk until well combined. 
            Pour flour mixture into the wet ingredients and whisk until just combined. 
            Fold in chocolate chips. Batter will be thick. Allow batter to rest for 5 minutes
        </li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat, and coat with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>
            Pour about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake onto the skillet. Cook until 
            bubbles appear on the surface, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip pancake with a spatula, 
            and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 more minutes. Repeat with remaining 
            batter. Serve immediately.
        </li>
    </ol>
