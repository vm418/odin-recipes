    <h1>Kefir Chocolate Chip Pancakes</h1>

    <p>
        I don't always make pancakes, but when I do, I prefer kefir chocolate chip pancakes. 
        I love traditional pancakes, but kefir gives these an extra dimension of fullness.
        When making these pancakes, I also highly recommend experimenting with various flavored
        kefirs, such as strawberry or pomegranate. I don't think of pancakes as healthy in 
        general, but this recipe calls for only 2 teaspoons of sugar. If you include chocolate 
        chips, you don't even need to use maple syrup. Enjoy some orange juice or a coffee with these.

            Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto 
            the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and
