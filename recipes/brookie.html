    <p> 
        These pancakes are a chocolate chip cookie pancake and a brownie in one! As an added bonus, you have a pan of brownies to nosh on later! Breakfast and midnight snack in one recipe. 
        Serve pancakes immediately, perhaps with a dollop of whipped cream!

        <li>1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>4/5 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons and 1/2 teaspoon semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>2/3 package brownie mix</li>
        <li>1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 1/3 eggs</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons and 1/2 teaspoon water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9-inch 
            baking pan with parchment paper; grease parchment paper with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>
            Combine buttermilk, egg, butter, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl, 
            beating to break up the egg. Add flour mixture; stir until just combined. Fold 
            chocolate chips gently into the batter. Allow batter to rest for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Combine brownie mix, oil, eggs, and water in a large bowl; whisk together until smooth.</li>
        <li>
            Pour 1/2 cup of the brownie batter into a squeeze bottle, pastry bag with a small round tip, 
            or large resealable plastic bag with corner snipped off. Reserve remaining batter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Drop 1/3 cup pancake batter into the skillet, 
            shaking skillet to spread batter evenly. Drop 5 nickel-size dollops of brownie batter over the pancake;
             swirl using a skewer or knife edge. Cook until edges are dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until set 
             on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batters.
        </li>
        <li>Pour reserved brownie batter into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 28 to 30 minutes. 
            Cool on a wire rack before slicing.
        </li>
    </ol>
